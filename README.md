This repository is destined to hold files in order to display some of the main Data Analytical skills developed by me, Gustavo Garofalo, in the past couple of years. 

Most of the skills displayed here were learned either by self studying or formal education, one of which is the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp, an intensive 24 week program offered by the University of Central Florida (Cerificate awarded in March 2020).

Performing API calls is a phenomenal skill that allows Data Analysts to collect accurate, updated and remote data in real time. Although sometimes the API calls are charged, you can find several websites that provides them for free.

The skill displayed in this repository is API calls, using a Python program.
